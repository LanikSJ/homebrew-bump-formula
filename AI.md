- **refactor**: Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- **perf**: Performance improvement
- **test**: Adding or correcting tests
- **chore**: Changes to build process or auxiliary tools

#### Scope Guidelines

- **action**: main action logic
- **docs**: documentation
- **tests**: test-related
- **ci**: CI/CD configuration
- **deps**: dependency updates

### When Making Changes

- Preserve existing functionality unless explicitly asked to change it
- Update documentation when modifying action behavior or adding features
- Test changes across different Homebrew formula scenarios
- **Always run markdownlint and fix all issues in markdown files before considering changes complete**
- **Always use Angular style commit messages for all commits**

### Homebrew Integration Standards

- Handle various formula formats and update patterns
- Implement proper version checking and comparison logic
- Provide clear feedback for formula update operations
- Test against real Homebrew formulae and repositories

## GitHub & Automation Standards

These rules apply specifically to files in `.github/*` (workflows, templates, and documentation).

### Quality Gates (MANDATORY)

Before completing any change in `.github/`:

1. ✅ Run `markdownlint` validation (if .md file).
2. ✅ Ensure project standards are followed.
3. ✅ Verify contribution guidelines are up-to-date.
4. ✅ Check that automation maintains project standards.

### Templates and Workflows

- Ensure issue and pull request templates provide clear, actionable guidelines.
- Include project-specific troubleshooting sections in templates.
- Reference existing project documentation and standards.

### Documentation standards in .github/

- `.github/CONTRIBUTING.md` must include:
  - Development environment setup instructions.
  - Testing requirements and procedures.
  - Documentation standards for new features.
  - Project-specific contribution guidelines.

### Automation and CI/CD

- Project workflows must include automated testing stages.
- Code quality checks must be integrated into CI/CD.
- Release automation must be properly configured.

### Error Prevention

- NEVER generate markdown that violates line length or formatting rules.
- ALWAYS cross-reference with existing project practices before making changes.
- ENSURE all links and references are valid and current.
- VALIDATE that new requirements don't conflict with established workflows.
